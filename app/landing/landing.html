						<p>SWiTHER solves a lifelong debacle of figuring out where to go to eat. 
						</p>
						<p>
						It's a timeless, exhausting, and frustrating struggle. You're with a friends or your significant other and you're so hungry you start to wonder what the other person would taste like with a little ranch. Before resorting to murder and cannibalism, try SWiTHER. We'll keep you from eating your friends, and find a happy place to eat instead.</p>

							<p class="p-2 text-left">It sounds crazy, but lets bring some logic into the equation.  First, decide what you don't want. You know when something doesn't sound that great, so you can save yourself a whole lot of work by having all parties eliminate what they aren't "in the mood for."</p>

You can tell me about hundreds of "things" that you want, but you have no idea what you want to eat at this moment?! You suggest pizza, but the other person just had that last night. They suggest Chinese, but you were planning on having Chinese with family later on in the day.</p>

Sometimes people just need a leader, and other times people just need to succomb to their destiny. SWiTHER is now your leader. You're welcome.</p>
