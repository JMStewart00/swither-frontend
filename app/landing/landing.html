						<p>SWiTHER is a web-based application that solves the hassle that follows the question "Where do you want to go?" 
						</p>
						<p>
						It's a timeless, exhausting, and frustrating struggle. You're with a group of friends or your significant other and you're so hungry you start to wonder what the other person would taste like with a little ranch. Before resorting to cannibalism, try SWiTHER. We'll keep you from eating your friends, and find a happy place to dine or go out for drinks instead.</p>
