			<p>For 12 weeks I spent over 500 hours engaged in learning something I knew completely nothing about. The app you're looking at is a culimnation of putting my life on hold to make a career change. It's also something I believe could really be something really cool </p>

			<p>...around version 5 or 6, that is.</p>

			<p>It's also the start of a really incredible passion that I feel I've developed. I love to program. Am I good at it? I don't know yet. But it's extremely fun. And frustrating. But mostly fun.</p>

			<p>Oh yeah! That mugshot below is me. My name is Josh Stewart and I put together this app for you and your friends and family. Wanna have a fun way to visit new places? Wanna make it easier to pick where you want to go with your significant other tonight? Just open up the app and search a place or two, get some matches, and away you go!</p>

			<p>This is just version one, and I had a little over nine days to work on it but I hope you enjoy it.</p>

			<p>Future features I hope to include in newer versions:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Facebook/Google Login</li>
				<li>Star Rating System for Likes</li>
				<li>Calendar Integration for specific days</li>
				<li>Notifications for matches</li>
				<li>More functionality of your own data</li>
				<li>Something else...</li>
			</ul>

			<p>Do you have a suggestion? Feel free to email me at jmstewart00@gmail.com to drop me a line to suggest something new! For now though, enjoy!</p>

			

			<p>Thank you for taking time to check out my app! If you want to you can see my portfolio <a href="JMStewart00.github.io" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
